# Description

**What's a masterkey?**

A masterkey integration is when someone connects a smaller blaster into a bigger blaster (for example: a Rough Cut integrated to a Retaliator). It takes its name from the real-life KAC Masterkey shotgun system, which consists of a pump-action shotgun mounted to the underbarrel of a firearm. The blasters which are most used as masterkeys are the Rough Cut 2x4, the Strongarm, and the Magnus, the latter two mounted upside down.
