# Description

**What's a masterkey?**

A masterkey integration is when someone connects a smaller blaster into a bigger blaster (for example: a Rough Cut integrated to a Retaliator). It takes its name from the real-life KAC Masterkey shotgun system, which consists of a pump-action shotgun mounted to the underbarrel of a firearm. The blasters which are most used as masterkeys are the Rough Cut 2x4, the Strongarm, and the Magnus, the latter two mounted upside down.

The CynthiaCore masterkey allows you to strap a straight-talon, micro-flywheel, Flycore blaster to the bottom of Sillybutts' Cynthia blaster for all your foam-flinging needs!
